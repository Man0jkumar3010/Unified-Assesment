Approach

I built this application using a component-based approach in React, focusing on reusability and clarity.

1. MainView Component
- Serves as the main layout for the team members list.
- Accepts props to make it reusable for similar views in the future.

2. MemberViewList Component
- Child of MainView.
- Displays a grid of member cards showing avatar, name, role, and status.
- Clicking a card opens a modal with more details.

3. SelectList Component
- Reusable dropdown component for role filtering.
- Can be used for additional filters in the future.

4. Modal with Tabs
- Shows detailed information about a member.
- Tabs separate Profile and Projects for better organization.

Why this approach:
- Components are modular and reusable.
- Layout and logic are clearly separated.
- Easy to extend or add new features later.
